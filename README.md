# Verseagility - NLP Toolkit
Verseagility is a Python-based toolkit for your custom natural language processing task, allowing you to bring your own data. It is a central component of the Microsoft Data Science Toolkit.

See the [documentation section](./docs/README.md) for detailed instructions how to get started with the toolkit.

## Supported Use Cases
- Binary, multi-class & multi-label classification
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering
- Text summarization

## Live Demo
The live demo of models resulting from Verseagility is hosted at Microsoft Technology Center Germany (MTC):
> https://verseagility.azurewebsites.net
