# Verseagility - NLP Toolkit
Verseagility is a Python-based toolkit to ramp up your custom natural language processing (NLP) task, allowing you to bring your own data, use your preferred frameworks and bring models into production. It is a central component of the Microsoft Data Science Toolkit.

## Why Verseagility?
Building NLP solutions which cover all components from text classification, named entity recognition to answer suggestion, require testing and integration effort. For this purpose, we developed this toolkit, which serves to minimize the setup time of an end-to-end solution and maximizes the time for use case-specific enhancements and adjustments. On this way, first results should be made available in an accelerated way when bringing individual, pre-labeled text document data and allow more time for iterative improvements.

See the [documentation section](./docs/README.md) for detailed instructions how to get started with the toolkit.

## Supported Use Cases
Verseagility is a modular toolkit that can be extended by further use-cases as needed. Following use-cases are already implemented and ready to be used:
- Binary, multi-class & multi-label classification
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering
- Opinion mining

## Live Demo
The toolkit paves the way to build consumeable REST APIs, for example in Azure Container Instances. These APIs may be used by the application of your choice: a website, a business process or just for testing purposes.
A web-based live demo of models resulting from Verseagility is hosted at the Microsoft Technology Center Germany (MTC):

    │
    ├── /docs              <- Detailed documentation.
    │
    ├── /notebook          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is <[Task]-[Short Description]>,
    │                         for example: 'Data - Exploration.ipynb'
    │
    ├── /pipeline          <- Document processing pipeline components, including document cracker. 
    │
    ├── /project           <- Project configuration files, detailing the tasks to be completed.
    │
    ├── /src               <- Source code for use in this project.
    │   ├── infer.py       <- Inference file, for scoring the model
    │   │   
    │   ├── data.py        <- Use case agnostic utils file, for data management incl upload/download
    │   │
    │   └── helper.py      <- Use case agnostic utils file, with common functions incl secret handling
    │
    ├── /tests              <- Unit tests (using pytest)
    │
    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    │
    ├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment.
    │                         Can be generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    │
    └── config.ini         <- Configuration and secrets used while developing locally
                              Secrets in production should be stored in the Azure KeyVault
