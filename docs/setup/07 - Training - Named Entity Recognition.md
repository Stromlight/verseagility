## Ranking Algorithm
The current version of Verseagility supports the Okapi BM25 information retrieval algorithm to sort historical question answer pairs by relevance. BM25 is a ranking approach used by search engines to estimate the relevance of a document to a given search query, such as a text or document. This is implemented using the [gensim library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/summarization/bm25.html). The ranking framework is accessed by the file `code/rank.py`.

## Potential Extensions
Due to the modular setup, this section can be extended to support the QNAMaker from Microsoft, or custom question answering algorithms using Transformers and FARM. Support for these may be added in coming versions of Verseagility.
