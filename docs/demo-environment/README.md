# Demo Environment Setup
This part of the documentation deals with the demo application for the NLP toolkit, which is based on [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).

The [Demo Setup Guide](01%20-%20Demo%20Environment%20Setup.md) helps you to build and deploy your own demo of the NLP toolkit in your subscription. There are different complexity levels how you can get this done and we provided you some hint which version might be appropriate for your personal purpose.

Further, we give you a hand how to present the existing demo in the most convincing and understanding way for your audience or customers in the [Presentation Guide](02%20-%20Presentation%20Guide.md).
